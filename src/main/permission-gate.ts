/**
 * Pi has no built-in sandbox or approval modes (see pi docs/security.md:
 * "No Built-in Sandbox"). The idiomatic way to gate sensitive operations is an
 * extension that hooks the `tool_call` event and confirms dangerous shell
 * commands via `ctx.ui.select` — which surfaces in MPI as the existing
 * extension-UI modal.
 *
 * The gate extension lives as a real source file (permission-gate-ext.ts) and
 * is bundled into the main process as a raw string. At runtime we write it into
 * the userData dir and load it for EVERY thread via `pi --extension <path>`.
 * Whether a thread actually gates is decided at runtime by a small per-thread
 * mode file ("sandbox" | "full") that the extension reads on each bash call, so
 * the permission level can be flipped live without restarting the pi process.
